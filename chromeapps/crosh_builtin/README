This directory contains a snapshot of the hterm extension built for use as
a component extension in chromeos-chrome.  It is provided so that users
can launch crosh without needing to install an extension from the app store.
This makes it possible to diagnose connectivity problems, which are likely
to make it impossible to get to the app store.

The ssh portions of hterm, including the NaCl plugin and nassh.(html|js) are
not included in the crosh_builtin extension.

The zip file in this directory can be recreated with the rezip.sh
script in this directory.
